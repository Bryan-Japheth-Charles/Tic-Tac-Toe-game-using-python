# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-using-python
This project is a graphical implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python's Tkinter library. It allows two players to engage in a fun and interactive game, where the objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row on a 3x3 grid.

Features
Player Turns: Alternating turns between two players, with the current player displayed at the top.
Win Detection: Highlights the winning combination in green when a player wins.
Tie Detection: Recognizes a tie when all grid spaces are filled without a winner, highlighting the grid in yellow.
Restart Game: A convenient restart button to reset the game and start a new round.

How It Works
The game board is a 3x3 grid where each player clicks to place their mark (X or O).
After each move, the game checks for a winner or a tie.
Players can start a new game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.
